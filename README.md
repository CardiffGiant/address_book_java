# address_book_java
Java implementation of an address book application.

This is the final form of an assignment for ICT 4315, Object-Oriented Programming, at the University of Denver.
Unfortunately I was not familiar with version control systems at the time of its creation, so there is only
the master branch.

Minimal attention was paid to the aesthetics of the application's UI. The focus was on the programmatical implementation
of the application.

The application utilizes ANT and a build file for compiling, testing, building, and running the program.
To run the address book application:
(On a Mac)
Navigate to the devl directory in the command line.
Input: ant run

This will compile the appropriate files.
The application should open automatically for use.
